# Tasty table recipe webapplication

This is a simple web application that allows users to create an account, search, save, and share recipes. The app uses the Edamam API to retrieve recipe data and Firebase as a backend to store user information. This application has been created for educational purposes, as part of my studies as a frontend developer.
